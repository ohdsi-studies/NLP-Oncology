StudyRepoTemplate
=================

An OHDSI study repository is expected to have a README.md file where the header conforms to a standard. A template README file is provided here:

**[README file template](templateREADME.md)**

When initiating a repository, please copy this file, rename it to 'README.md', and fill in the fields as appropriate.

The information in the repository README file will be used to automatically update the [list of OHDSI research studies](https://data.ohdsi.org/OhdsiStudies/), so it is important to fill in the template accurately, and keep it up-to-date.

## Elements in the README template

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Study title]      | A meaningful title of the research project.            
| Study status badge | A badge indicating the study status. See [below](#study-status) for valid options. |
| Analytics use case | One or more analytics use cases included in the study (in a comma-separated list). See [below](#analytics-use-cases) for valid options. |
| Study type | The type of study. See [below](#study-types) for valid options. |
| Tags | Zero, one, or more additional keywords that can be used to filter the list of studies. The list of tags is not restricted, but be conservative in making up new tags. For example: `EHDEN` to identify studies that are part of the [EHDEN project](https://www.ehden.eu/). |
| Study lead | The name of the study lead.|
| Study lead forums tag | The OHDSI forums tag of the study lead, which can be used to contact the lead. It is recommended to make this a hyperlink to lead's forums profile |
